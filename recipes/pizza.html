    <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
        <ul>
            <li>1 ball pizza dough</li>
            <li>all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Semolina flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup pizza sauce</li>
            <li>3 ounces shredded mozzarella</li>
            <li>fresh basil</li>
        </ul>   
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Let chilled covered dough stand at room temperature until dough is cool (not cold) and a fingerprint remains when dough is pressed, 1 to 2 hours. Transfer 1 dough ball to a heavily floured surface. Using floured fingertips, firmly press all over dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border.</li>
            <li>if cooking in your home oven, preheat to 500Â°F with a baking steel or large round cast-iron pizza pan (such as Lodge 15-inch) on middle rack. Let pan preheat in oven for about 30 minutes. If using an outdoor pizza oven, preheat pizza oven and pizza stone according to manufacturer's instructions on high 20 minutes.</li>
